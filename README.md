# requirements

* WLED compatible
* battery powered with the possibility to bypass with USB power
* brightness comparable to a strip of ws2812b leds
* programmable without external hardware

# fixme

* LED footprint is confusing as the silkscreen EP marking is pointing to pin 1, not the cathode (pin 8)

# TODO

* micro-usb to type-c
* battery connector needs to be 2 through holes for AWG24 with the soldermask intact on the bottom side
* change the second button to a power switch?
* mounting holes
* gather datasheets to a common location
